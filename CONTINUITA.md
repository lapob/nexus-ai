# Website source continuity

Updated 6 October 2026. Source collaboration branch: `website` in `lapob/nexus-ai`. Application/server/Android source uses `main`; these are separate trees.

The public website remains on its previously verified production version. Local source includes links for Windows Preview 0.3.28 and Android 6.5.24. Release metadata was matched against the public GitHub manifest, asset digest, version and byte count. Production promotion remains blocked by the dependency security gate for GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm in braces. Do not bypass the gate, fabricate a patched version or claim these links are deployed.

The development dependency source-map-js is updated from1.2.1 to the patched1.2.2 for GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q. Source build, performance and37tests pass after this update and the verified0.3.28 metadata; registry signatures pass. The new source commit requires its own remote check. The release security gate still rejects the remaining braces chain. No production version was changed.

Use Node 24 and `npm ci`, then `npm run cloud:check` for source checks. Production additionally requires `npm run verify:security`, the browser/performance checks and the existing prepare/promote pipeline. No Cloudflare credentials are needed for source work. Leave the agent's internet access disabled unless a task requires it; setup needs dependency access.

Before resuming an interrupted operation, inspect Git and previous logs. Keep current production and rollback identifiers in the private workstation checkpoint. Update this public file with actual source checks and commits, excluding tokens, personal information and local data.
